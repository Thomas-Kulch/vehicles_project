# CarMin - Used Vehicles Project

![img_1]('images/img_1.jpg')
 
 In this project, I use a used cars inventory dataset to create some useful visualizations that can help with shopping for cars.

 This tool lets you filter the type of car you want and shows some visualizations and let's you compare types of cars available by the manufacturer.

 I utilize the pandas, plotly.express, and streamlit libraries to clean the dataset, create visualizations, and create a web app to display the final results.
